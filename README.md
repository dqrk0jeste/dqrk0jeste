## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Darko and I am a student at The School of Electrical Engineering in Belgrade. I enjoy programming and making stuff I personally find useful.

### My projects
- mwc [source](https://github.com/dqrk0jeste/mwc) - Tiling wayland compositor written in C primarily made to fit my taste and needs, but grown up to a fairly large project packing a lot of features!

Other projects that are either too simple or unfinished to be featured up there
- Terminal Snake [source](https://github.com/dqrk0jeste/ncurses-snake) - Popular snake game in your terminal. Written in C using ncurses library.
- justcube [frontend](https://github.com/dqrk0jeste/justcube-frontend) [backend](https://github.com/dqrk0jeste/justcube-backend) (unfinished) - Webapp made as a social platform for cubers to share their solves, thought etc but also hang out, solve together and race in real-time rooms. Written in Go + Vue.js, but never finished.
- Keyboard Shop [source](https://github.com/dqrk0jeste/keyboards) [site](https://keyboards-three.vercel.app/) (unfinished) - I wanted to open an online shop for custom mechanical keyboards, so I made a site for that purpose. Although it's not finished it turned out nice. Made using Nuxt.js.
- Rarog [frontend](https://github.com/dqrk0jeste/rarog-frontend) [backend](https://github.com/dqrk0jeste/rarog-backend) (unfinished) - I was part of a school project for third and fourth grade students at my former high school. I mainly made development tools like Docker containers, CI/CD pipelines, but also a large part of the frontend.
- Private Lessons [source](https://github.com/dqrk0jeste/privatni-casovi) [site](https://privatni-casovi.vercel.app/) - Used to give private lessons back in highschool with a few of my friends, so I created a booking site for it. Website looks pretty nice, but the code is horrendous, pls dont look at it.
