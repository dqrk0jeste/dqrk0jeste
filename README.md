## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Darko and I am a student at The School of Electrical Engineering in Belgrade. I enjoy programming and making stuff I personally find useful.

### My projects
- owl [source](https://github.com/dqrk0jeste/owl) - Tiling wayland compositor written in C made to fit my taste and needs. Actively in development, but ready to use!

There are also other projects that are either too simple or unfinished to be featured up there
- justcube [frontend](https://github.com/dqrk0jeste/justcube-frontend) [backend](https://github.com/dqrk0jeste/justcube-backend) (unfinished) - Webapp made as a social platform for cubers to share their solves, thought etc but also hang out, solve togehter and race in real time rooms. Written in Go + Vue.js, but never finished.
- Snake in Terminal [source](https://github.com/dqrk0jeste/ncurses-snake) - Snake game to play in terminal. Written in C using ncurses library.
- Keyboard Shop [source](https://github.com/dqrk0jeste/keyboards) (unfinished) - I wanted to open a shop for selling custom keyboards, so I made this site for the purpose. Although it's not finished it turned out nice. Made using Nuxt.js.
- Rarog [frontend](https://github.com/dqrk0jeste/rarog-frontend) [backend](https://github.com/dqrk0jeste/rarog-backend) (unfinished) - I was part of a school project for third and fourth grade students at my former high school. I mainly made development tools like Docker containers, CI/CD pipelines for running migrations (through GitHub actions) and also a large part of the frontend part.
- Private Lessons [source](https://github.com/dqrk0jeste/privatni-casovi) - Used to give private lessons back in highschool with a few of my friends, so I created a booking site for that purpose. Website looks pretty nice, but the code is horrendous, pls dont look at it.
